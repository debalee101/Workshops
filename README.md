# Workshops
<em> Here I am storing the coding exercises that I carried out as a part of various workshops on multiple topics. I'll keep adding the details of the workshops in the list that follows. That shall include the link to the workshops (if available, else the link might link to an upcoming session of the same workshop and the contents might be modified by the author) and the details of the instructor/instructors.
The folders within each workshop-folder shall contain a separate README file with the description of the assigned tasks and contents.

### Causal Inference Part I

[Find the link to an upcoming session of the workshop here](https://www.mixtapesessions.io/session/ci_I_sept3) (The contents might be modified by the author)

Instructor: [Prof. Scott Cunningham](http://www.scunning.com/) ([Baylor University](https://www.baylor.edu/))

Causal Inference Part I is a 4-day series on design-based causal inference series. It covers the foundations of causal inference grounded in a counterfactual theory of causality built on the Neyman-Rubin model of potential outcomes. It also covers randomization inference, independence, matching, regression discontinuity and instrumental variables. Also encompasses reviewing the theory behind each of these designs in detail with the aim being comprehension, competency and confidence. This is the prequel to the Part II course that covers difference-in-differences and synthetic control.
